# TDT4250 - Assignment 2 - Unit Converter

```
Unit converter using OSGi
```

## Structure
```
**tdt4250.converter.api** - API for components
**tdt4250.converter.gogo** - Commands for gogo console
**tdt4250.converter.rest** - Should be used to convert values
**tdt4250.converter.servlet** - Servlet for web service 

```
## Setup
```
To run the project, launch the launch.bndrun in the tdt4250.convert.servlet project. I haven't actually added any converter methods, but something is working at least!
